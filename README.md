- Code won't run unless you download the GoogleNews-vector-negative300.bin file, which is ~1.5 gb

- Also need these packages:
   - sklearn
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - nltk.corpus
   - gensim
   
Things to do:

- not sure why I'm randomly saving the transition matrix and t distribution as a csv, could be useful for if i want to switch to R?
- Save the kmeans cluster matrix, it will save a lot of time when rerunning the program
- add verb, noun, etc. grouping (but creates huge transition matrices which is problematic)
